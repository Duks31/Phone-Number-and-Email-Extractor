Say you have the boring task of finding every phone number and email 
address in a long web page or document. If you manually scroll through 
the page, you might end up searching for a long time. But if you had a program 
that could search the text in your clipboard for phone numbers and 
email addresses, you could simply press ctrl-A to select all the text, press 
ctrl-C to copy it to the clipboard, and then run your program. It could 
replace the text on the clipboard with just the phone numbers and email 
addresses it finds.

# •	 Use the pyperclip module to copy and paste strings.
# •	 Create two regexes, one for matching phone numbers and the other for 
#    matching email addresses.
# •	 Find all matches, not just the first match, of both regexes.
# •	 Neatly format the matched strings into a single string to paste.
# •	 Display some kind of message if no matches were found in the text.
